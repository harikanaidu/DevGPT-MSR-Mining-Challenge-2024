# DevGPT

Dataset and background: 

DevGPT is a carefully curated database of conversations between developers and ChatGPT, obtained by tracking the mentions of ChatGPT and crawling the weblinks with the help of GraphQL. Essentially, the dataset consists of snapshots of conversations in JSON format captured at six different time periods along with timestamps, namely July 27, August 3, August 10, August 17, August 24 and August 31, 2023. [being updated constantly with some data captured in September too]. The challenge here is to parse the JSON files and analyze the developer-ChatGPT conversations to answer a few research questions in an attempt to better understand the quality of responses, capabilities of ChatGPT in programming contests and scope for improvement.
